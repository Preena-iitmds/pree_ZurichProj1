# This file describes my findings from the ZURICH:50 set
* I scraped the data using Python code, using personal access token and the request.get() function
* I find it interesting that more repos are not directly proportional to more followers.
* Familiarity with Python, focussing on quality bios (rather than just long ones) and ensuring to follow reasonable number of profiles are suggestions for developers.
